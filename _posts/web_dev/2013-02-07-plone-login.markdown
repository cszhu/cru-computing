Logging into your website can be achieved by simply typing in /login_form at the end of your plone site.

For instance if you are managing caes.ucdavis.edu you can login by entering caes.ucdavis.edu/login_form in the URL

If you are working in the server side address (8080) then you'll be given a button in the top right with the option to login and log out.
